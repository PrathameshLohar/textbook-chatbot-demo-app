# 📘 LLaMA 2 Textbook QA Bot

A Streamlit application that uses a fine-tuned [LLaMA 2 7B](https://huggingface.co/Prathamesh25/Llama-2-7b-textbook-chatbot) model for answering curriculum-based textbook questions. The model has been trained using QLoRA on a custom educational QA dataset.

## 🧠 About the Model

- **Base model:** [NousResearch/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf](https://huggingface.co/NousResearch/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf)
- **Fine-tuned model:** [Prathamesh25/Llama-2-7b-textbook-chatbot](https://huggingface.co/Prathamesh25/Llama-2-7b-textbook-chatbot)
- **Training dataset:** [Prathamesh25/qa-textbook-transformed-dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Prathamesh25/qa-textbook-transformed-dataset)
- **Training method:** QLoRA (4-bit) using `trl.SFTTrainer`

---

## 🚀 Demo

Ask any question from your science textbook (class 6–8 level), and the bot will respond in a concise, factual format.

## 💻 How to Run Locally

### 1. Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
cd <your-repo-name>
````

### 2. Install dependencies

We recommend using a virtual environment.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the Streamlit app

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

---

## 🧾 Requirements

Dependencies include:

* `transformers`
* `torch`
* `streamlit`
* `bitsandbytes`
* `accelerate`
* `peft`
* `trl`

(See `requirements.txt`)

---

## 🧠 Model Loading and Interaction

The app uses 4-bit quantization (`BitsAndBytesConfig`) to load the model efficiently on low-memory GPUs. It only downloads the model once and caches it locally.

```python
prompt = "<s>[INST] What is photosynthesis? [/INST]"
```

This prompt is passed to the model, which returns a relevant answer from the textbook-trained dataset.

* **Batch size:** 4
* **Precision:** QLoRA 4-bit + FP16
* **LoRA config:** r=64, alpha=16, dropout=0.1
